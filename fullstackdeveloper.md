## Full Stack Developer

Being a Full-Stack Developer doesn’t mean that you have necessarily mastered everything required to work with the front-end or back-end, but it means that you are able to work on both sides and understand what is going on when building an application.

1. HTML/CSS
  - Semantic HTML
  - Be able to explain the CSS Box Model
  - Benefits of CSS preprocessors (you don’t necessarily need to understand how to use one on a deep level, but you should to understand what they are for and how they help with development)
  - CSS Media Queries to target different devices and write responsive CSS
  - Bootstrap (a framework for helping design and layout content on a page and while many online programs or schools focus heavily on teaching Bootstrap, in reality it’s more important to have a deep knowledge of fundamental CSS than specific Bootstrap features and methods)
1. JavaScript
  - Understand how to work with the DOM. Also know what JSON is and how to manipulate it
  - Important language features such as functional composition, prototypal inheritance, closures, event delegation, scope, higher-order functions
  - Asynchronous control flow, promises, and callbacks
  - Learn how to properly structure your code and modularize parts of it, things like webpack, browserify, or build tools like gulp will definitely be helpful to know
  - Know how to use at least one popular framework (many programs will focus heavily on teaching you a library or framework like React or AngularJS, but in reality it’s much more important to have a deep understanding of the JavaScript language and not focus so much on framework-specific features. Once you have a good understanding of JavaScript, picking up a framework that sits on top of it won’t be too hard anyway)
  - Although some may argue that you should be using this less or that it’s slowly dying, jQuery code still exists in most applications and a solid understanding of it will be helpful
  - Some knowledge on testing frameworks and why they’re important (some may even claim that this topic should be optional)
  - Learn about some important new ES6 features (optional)
1. Back-End Language
  - things like database operations, user authentication, and application logic
  - Node.js: This is a great option because Node.js is itself just a JavaScript environment which means you don’t need to learn a new language. This is a big reason why a lot of online programs and bootcamps choose to teach Node.js. The most popular framework you’d most likely learn to aid you in developing web applications is Express
  - Ruby: Some popular frameworks for developing in Ruby are Rails and Sinatra. Plenty of programs teach Ruby as a first back-end language
  - Python: Some popular frameworks for developing in Python are Django and Flask
  - Java: The Java language isn’t taught so much these days when it comes to Full-Stack Web Development, but some companies do use Java as their back-end and it is still a very in-demand language (see image above)
  - PHP: PHP is rarely taught in programs these days, but just like with Java, it is still very in-demand and it is a cornerstone of the web today
1. Databases & Web Storage
  - Understand the benefits of relational data, e.g. SQL
  - Learn about NoSQL databases, e.g. MongoDB
  - Understand which would be better in certain situations
  - Know how to connect a database with your chosen back-end language (e.g. Node.js + MongoDB)
  - Understand the benefits of in-memory data stores like Redis or memcached
  - Web storage to store sessions, cookies, and cached data in the browser
  - Scaling databases, ACID, and ORM (all optional)
1. HTTP & REST
  - AJAX 
  - What is REST and why is it important in regards to the HTTP protocol and web applications
  - Best practices for designing a RESTful API. POST/GET requests
  - Learning how to use Chrome DevTools can be extremely helpful
  - What are SSL Certificates
  - HTTP/2 & SPDY (optional)
  - WebSockets, Web Workers, and Service Workers (all optional)
1. Web Application Architecture
  - how to structure your code, how to separate your files, where to host your large media files, how to structure the data in your database, where to perform certain computational tasks (client-side vs server-side)
  - large/complex application
  - architect and design applications to be most efficient and can see the “big picture” when it comes to development
  - Learn about common platforms as a service, e.g. Heroku and AWS. Heroku allows you to easily upload your code and have an application up and running with very little configuration or server maintenance and AWS offers dozens of products and services to help with storage, video processing, load balancing, and much more
  - Performance optimization for applications and modern browsers
  - Some opinions on what a web application architecture should include
  - Designing Web Applications by Microsoft
  - MVC
  - Most importantly though you should try to work on projects with people, look at codebases of popular projects on GitHub, and learn as much as you can from senior developers
1. Git
1. Basic Algorithms & Data Structures
  - computer science topics like tree traversal, sorting, algorithm analysis, matrix manipulation
  - Improving your Algorithms & Data Structure Skills Article
  - Study hash tables and try to understand them on a deeper level. This data structure underlies objects in JavaScript (dictionaries in Python and hashes in Ruby)
  - Understand how trees and graphs can be beneficial as data structures
  - Understand the basics of Big-O analysis so you don’t do silly things like create a nested loop 3 levels down if you don’t need to!
  - Know when to use an object vs an array and understand the trade-offs
  - Learn why caching is so important when working with a large amount of data. Also learn the pros and cons of in-memory vs disk storage
  - Learn the difference between queues and stacks
