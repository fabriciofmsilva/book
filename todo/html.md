# HTML

HTML foi desenvolvido a partir de um protótipo criado por Tim Berners-Lee em 1992. Tim pensou na possibilidade de conectar ('linkar') documentos com o uso de hipertexto. O HTML foi derivado de uma outra linguagem de marcação, o SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language).

HTML originated from a prototype created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992. Berners-Lee felt that there was a possibility of linking documents together by the use of hypertext, and the concept of HTML evolved. The drawback was that the commercial hypertext packages available at that time, such as Zog and Intermedia, were customized to suit different types of computers and were too ambiguous in nature.

Juntamente com o HTML (HyperText Markup Language), Tim desenvolveu um protocolo de acesso a docuemntos via hiperlink. O protocolo foi chamado HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) e isso possibilitou a *World Wide Web*.

Berners-Lee developed HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and in conjunction, he developed a protocol to access text from other documents via hyperlinks. The protocol was called HTTP, and this paved the way for the future. HTML itself was derived from a markup language called (Standard Generalized Markup Language) (SGML).

Standardization being an ongoing process, modifications were constantly made and versions were released accordingly. The various versions of HTML that have been released are as follows:

f HTML 2.0 (November 1995)
f HTML 3.2 (January 1997)
f HTML 4.0 (December 1997)
f HTML 4.01 (December 1999)
f HTML5, which is widely used, but is still in the development stage

Another breakthrough in the field was the introduction of CSS along with HTML 4.0. Prior to the introduction of CSS, web designers and developers used HTML for formatting purposes.
Formatting and styling a web page using HTML defeats the purpose of HTML, because HTML elements and attributes must only define the structure of the web page. The purpose of CSS was to separate styling out from structural markup. With the introduction of CSS, we could separate presentation from content. As a result, formatting could be separated from the HTML document and stored in a separate file, which could then be included in the document using a link tag.

Instead of wandering through loads of theory, we will understand HTML practically with the help of code examples in this book. We have used Notepad for the examples in this book. Alternatively, you can also use Notepad++ or any advanced editor such as Adobe Dreamweaver. To execute the code, all you need to do is copy the code and paste it into Notepad. Upon execution, you will get the output as depicted in the screenshots. Coding gets better with practice. Instead of using the verbatim code in the book, you can alter the code and see the change in the output to understand HTML better.


	At the time of writing this book, HTML 4.0 is supported by most of the browsers. This means that you can execute the code in major browsers such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox. However, when we move on to HTML5, this might not be the case. HTML5 is still in the development stage and is expected to be released later this year. After HTML5 is accepted as the norm, it will be standardized and supported by all major browsers. Browser support for the forms and attributes in HTML5 is explained in detail at http://www.wufoo.com/html5/. This also indicates which browsers are supporting which features and to what degree.
