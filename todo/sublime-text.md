# Sublime Text

## Keyboard Only Rename

Renaming files is a pain - if you rename them outside of Sublime Text and have thme open, Sublime Text doesn't update the name. This is why I prefer to rename everything when I have the file open in my editor.


Now, you know me. I hate using the mouse when I don't have to! That said, Sublime doesn't come with a way to rename files without using the mouse but oddly enough, SidebarEnhancements adds file rename to the command palette.

That's it!





## Fast Tab Switching

This week's trick is something that works in almost any tabbed program like Chrome, Slack and Sublime Text. However, it's a small tip that I often find people aren't aware of. So, let's take a few seconds to learn something new:


Hold Down ⌘ and Alt (Ctrl + Alt for Window) and use your arrow keys to cycle through your previous and next tabs. Then hold down ⌘ (Ctrl on Windows) and hit numbers 1 through 9 to get to tabs 1 through 9.

Easy! Start using it today.
